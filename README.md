The selected code implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm in C++ to find the shortest paths in a graph with weighted edges, including those with negative weights. The serial implementation iteratively relaxes all edges to compute the shortest path.

# For more updates you gotta wait! 
It's still iin production :)
